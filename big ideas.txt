have some sort of limit on turns per encounter:
why? 
prevents stalling [allows for economy/ healing symbols]
most solutions seem to improve rng feel - more chances to get that big hit instead of being threatened every turn


1. limit number of rolls:
	pros: 
		simple
		easier to balance
		gives economic incentive to finish fights fast
		
	cons: 
		uninteresting?
		boss fights need to be different?
		limits builds & strategy
		makes block kinda useless?

2. double enemy's level every turn:
	pros: interesting
	cons: 
		too big of jumps between turns? 
		hard to balance

3. increase enemy attack and have them wait before attacking


4. some mix of everything: start off weak and after a few turns double level every turn, based on enemy attribute !
