weapons:
- instead of attack: roll
- instead of attack: gain mana
- instead of attack: defend
- instead of attack: poison for double damage
- attacks hit all enemies
- lifesteal - (no defense?)
- minions attack instead?
- attack with your block stat instead of att stat


system that will allow this:
make attack button just activate weapon.basic_attack of a weapon resource/ ABSTRACT class, which every class inheriting from will have to implement.

equipment vs relics: (probably both why not ...)
equipment pros:
-can switch builds more effectively



character builds:
block + attack scaling: [survive turns through high defense, all the while scaling your attack]
	symbols:
	- +1 attack permanently 
	- high block symbols
	
	weapons:
	- instead of attacking double it for next turn [cant double twice]
