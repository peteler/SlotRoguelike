weapons:
- instead of attack: roll
- instead of attack: gain mana
- instead of attack: defend
- instead of attack: poison for double damage
- attacks hit all enemies
- lifesteal - (no defense?)
- minions attack instead?
- attack with your block stat instead of att stat


system that will allow this:
make attack button just activate weapon.basic_attack of a weapon resource/ ABSTRACT class, which every class inheriting from will have to implement.

equipment vs relics: (probably both why not ...)
equipment pros:
-can switch builds more effectively



character builds:
block + attack scaling: [survive turns through high defense, all the while scaling your attack]
	symbols:
	- +n base attack permanently [once per fight? how to fix annoying gameplay of looking for it? always shows up on first roll?]
	- high block symbols
	
	weapons:
	- instead of attacking, double attack for next turn [cant double twice]
	
block + poison: [play the long game, survive via block while poison does damage every turn]





first encounter:
- shouldn't lose more than 5 hp ever
- shouldn't take more than 4 turns ever (usually 2-3)
- should use 1 spell

howto: 
- average block should be at most 1 less average enemy attk
- enemy hp should be the average attack times 2.5
- enemy should have 1 strong turn - second or third turn maybe
